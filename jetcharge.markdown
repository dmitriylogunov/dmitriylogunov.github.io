I worked with a team of Developers, Hardware Engineers, and DevOps specialists to deliver a B2B charging management platform. I took the project from a prototype stage and developed the UI to the point of the first alpha client onboarding. I collaborated with a UI designer to improve the product's usability. Below you can find some screenshots of my work. For more information on JETCharge, visit [jetcharge.com.au](https://jetcharge.com.au).
